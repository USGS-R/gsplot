##Installation
Currently only available via github. Easiest way to install is to use the `devtools` package:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("USGS-R/gsplot")
```

This package is still very much in development, so the API may change at any time.

##Overview
The goal of this package is to simplify plotting in R. This includes improving the basic workflow and using defaults that tend to adhear to USGS style guidelines.

##Improved workflow examples

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(gsplot)

demoPlot <- gsplot() %>% 
 points(x=1, y=2, legend.name="Points 1", pch=19, xlab="Label 1", ylab="1st Y") %>% 
 points(x=3, y=4, side=c(1,4), legend.name="Points 2", pch=5, col="blue", ylab="2nd Y") %>% 
 lines(x=c(3,4,3), y=c(2,4,6), legend.name="Lines 1", lty=5, lwd=3) %>%
 lines(x=c(1,2,5), y=c(1,8,5), legend.name="Lines 2", lty=5, col="green") %>% 
 abline(a=0, b=1) %>%
 legend(location="topleft", title="Fake data")

demoPlot
